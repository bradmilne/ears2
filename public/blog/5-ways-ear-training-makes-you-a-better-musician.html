	<h1>5 Ways Ear Training Makes You a Better Musician<h1>

	<p>Ear training is one of the most valuable things you can practice as a musician. For all of the theory that you can memorize or work out on instrument, at the end of the day you still need to be able to hear it. And the ability to instantly recognize and understand what you're hearing will help you in a number of ways.

<br /><br />

<h3>1. The Ability to 'Hear' Music Theory</h3>
<br />

Take one of my favorite scales, the melodic minor. I can remember trying to learn it before I took up ear training seriously and it was frustrating. This was because I was learning it from theory and fretboard patterns alone. Don't get me wrong, those are an important part of the process of learning a new scale, but they pale in comparison to being able to hear and understand exactly what makes up a scale.<br /><br />

For the melodic minor, bring able to instantly recognize the minor 3rd and the major 7th as the crucial ingredients to the melodic minor sound, meant that I was not only able to aurally recognize the scale, but I could relate it to the theory as well. That combination makes it incredibly easy to stick in your head.<br /><br />

<h3>2. Significantly Easier to Memorize Tunes</h3>
<br />

For as long as I can remember I've been interested in learning other languages. One of the things you notice when you study languages is that's very easy to learn a word in a new language if you already know it in another. For instance, take the word dog. When I was learning some Spanish I already knew that in Italian it's 'cane' and in French it's 'chien' - so it was very easy to learn it as 'perro' in Spanish. But why is that? <br /><br />

The way that memory works is that the more pathways that your brain has to access a memory, the easier it is. For instance if I'm thinking of a particular time when I was on vacation in Sicily then I can remember one of my favorite nights by the incredible sunset from my hotel balcony AND the surprisingly good taste of the 5 Euro jug of wine AND the hilarious moment when my friend chipped his tooth on that jug of wine trying to drink out of it - then I have 3 ways that my brain can access that memory. <br /><br />

So for music and memorizing tunes, if I can think of the melody in terms of the sound AND (because of ear training) the exact interval sequence AND how the song makes me feel then I'm much better off than just knowing the sound. NOTE: this is also why it's such a great reason to learn the lyrics of a tune if there are any.<br /><br />

<h3>3. Being Able to Play What You Hear</h3>
<br />

It's something that's coveted by all musicians - the ability to play what you hear in your head. By training your ears you have an incredible advantage over other musicians as as soon as you hear a melody in your head you already know the notes that you have to play to make it a reality on your instrument. One of my favorite videos on Youtube is George Benson sitting down with Jody Fisher and just seeing the total command that George Benson has over music because he can play exactly what he hears: <br /><br />

Again it comes down to learning it all together - the theory, the technique and the ears at the same time. But being able to instantly understand the intervals and notes you need to play to make use of a scale or a melody in your head makes it much, much easier to improvise. <br /><br />


<h3>4. Transcribing and Composing Music in No Time</h3>
<br />

This one may be obvious, but for those who are transcribing and analyzing music, your life becomes incredibly easy when you're immediately recognizing intervals and chord changes. Certainly for jazz, it's a rite of passage to transcribe the music of the greats (and incredibly worthwhile to your understanding of the music and your musicianship in general) and there's no substitute to being able to pick out chord changes and melodies quickly. <br /><br />

The same increase in efficiency applies for composing. By being able to understand exactly what you want to sound like, you can quickly note the chord progressions that you're thinking of and how the melody applies to them.<br /><br />

<h3>5. Enjoying Music More!</h3>
<br />

For me, the more I understand about the music I'm listening to, the easier it is for me to enjoy it. I remember the first time I heard jazz and I had no idea what was going on or why anyone would want to listen to it. As I learned more theory and analyzed some tunes I could start to understand what the musicians were actually doing and I started to appreciate the music and the craft behind it much more.

<br /><br />
By being able to 'hear' what's going on, whether it's classical, jazz or rock, I find it easier to be absorbed by the music and to get the most out of it. <br /> <br />

<h3>Get Those Ears Working</h3>
<br />

Music is just sound. That sound can be complicated given time signatures, instrumentation, dynamics, tone, etc.  - but if you can marry the theory that you study with exactly what your ears pick up, there isn't an aspect of your musicianship that you won't improve.<br /><br />
